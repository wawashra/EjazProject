At Birzeit University, students use the social media to share learning materials such as exams and lecture slides. However, the social media such as Facebook and Twitter are not designed to facilitate such group work. For instance, when using Facebook to share documents, it becomes very hard to search for specific document. Further, the posts on Facebook are not grouped together, so every post is a seperate one making grouping and categorization of documents a non-trivial task. In this project we intend to develop a comprehensive platform for student sharing of documents and materials. Using carefully selected technologies such as Angular, Spring Boot, and MySQL Database, we intend to develop a web-based portal that is easy to use even by non-computing students. The portal should be able to be navigated using small, medium, and large screens, in other terms, it should be responsive. Another important feature of our portal is the ability for students to share materials between them . The portal should encompass carefully selected user interface design patterns in order to make it easy to use. At the core of our portal, is the hierarchy tree, which enable students to group together related posts and material
